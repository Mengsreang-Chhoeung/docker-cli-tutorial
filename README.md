# Docker CLI Tutorial

## Part 1: What is Docker?

### 1. The Problem Before Docker

Before containerization, developers and operations teams frequently ran into the "It works on my machine!" syndrome.

- **Environment Drift**: A project might work perfectly on a developer’s macOS or Windows laptop, but fail on an Ubuntu production server due to differences in OS versions, system libraries, or installed dependencies.

- **Complex Onboarding**: Setting up a new team member's machine meant installing databases, runtimes, and background tools manually—a process prone to human error and time-wasting troubleshooting.

### 2. What Docker Solves

Docker solves environment inconsistencies by packaging an application along with **all of its dependencies, configurations, and libraries** into a standardized unit called a **container**.

- **Portability**: If it runs in a Docker container on your machine, it will run identically on any server, cloud provider, or teammate's machine.

- **Isolation**: Containers run in isolated environments on the host system, ensuring applications don't conflict with one another (e.g., running Node.js v16 and Node.js v20 side-by-side).

### 3. Virtual Machines vs. Containers

| Feature            | Virtual Machines (VMs)              | Docker Containers                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Architecture**   | Includes full Guest OS + Hypervisor | **Shares Host OS Kernel**                  |
| **Size**           | **Gigabytes (GBs)**                 | **Megabytes (MBs)**                        |
| **Boot Time**      | **Minutes**                         | **Seconds or milliseconds**                |
| **Resource Usage** | Heavy (CPU/RAM hardware allocation) | **Lightweight (uses resources on demand)** |
